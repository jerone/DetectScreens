# DetectScreens

A proof-of-concept that I could duplicate Windows detect screens. 

## Description

This program will identify all your screens and visually display them as Windows "Screen Resolution" window does.
The big difference is that it will display the screens in realtime (see 1st screenshot). 
That means that when you move a window, this program will show that movement too!
Pressing the big "Identify" button will detect and identify all your screens (see 2nd screenshot).

_At the moment of writting this readme, I didn't have a second monitor available to make better screenshots._

## Disclamer

This program was build in ~2012 and I'll probably not update it.
